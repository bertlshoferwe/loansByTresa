Primarily, the federal government insures loans for FHA- approved lenders in order to reduce their risk of loss if a borrower defaults on their mortgage payments.Typically the borrower can be approved with 3.5% down vs 20% that is required on other loan programs. FHA Loans are a great option for first time home buyers, thanks to the flexible credit score requirements and down payments. The FHA helps protect lenders, making it easier for non-traditional borrowers to buy a home.' />
